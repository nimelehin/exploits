# User pointer bounds in Kernel

The code allows to get root access. `umem_copy_to_user` and `umem_copy_from_user` don't have a check for user pointer bounds allowing to read/write into kernel space. 
Fixed in [effd7ec10](https://github.com/opuntiaOS-Project/opuntiaOS/commit/effd7ec10445001f3fa57c4ed3d9baeab327583e).
